# BotWRouter
This is a toolkit that allows you to route out various BotW categories using a weighted TSP algorithm.  
It currently uses height differences and warps to hopefully speedup the route.  

## Usage  
First, install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
Then, run the script for the category you want`python shrines.py` or `python hundo.py`
